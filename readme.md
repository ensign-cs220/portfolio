# Overview

A software engineer's portfolio page is a website that showcases their skills, experience, and projects. There are several reasons why a software engineer should have a portfolio page:

Professionalism: A portfolio page demonstrates professionalism and a commitment to one's craft. It shows that the engineer is willing to take the time and effort to showcase their work and highlight their skills.

Personal branding: A portfolio page can help a software engineer to establish their personal brand and stand out from other candidates. It allows them to present their work in a way that showcases their unique strengths and abilities.

Career development: A portfolio page can be a valuable tool for career development. It can help a software engineer to attract potential employers and clients, and it can also be used to showcase their work to other professionals in the field.

Documentation: A portfolio page can serve as a record of a software engineer's work, providing a central location for them to document their projects and accomplishments.

In short, a portfolio page is a useful tool for software engineers to showcase their skills, establish their personal brand, and advance their careers. It can also be a valuable tool for documentation and career development.

## Our Stack

For our portfolio website, we will use the following stack:

-   HTML: HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language used to create and structure web pages. It provides the structure and content of my portfolio website.
-   Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of low-level utility classes for building web designs. I used Tailwind CSS to style and layout my portfolio website.
-   AlpineJS: AlpineJS is a lightweight JavaScript framework that allows me to add interactivity to my web pages. I used AlpineJS to create dynamic behavior and enhance the user experience on my portfolio website.

This stack allows us to create a visually appealing and interactive portfolio website with minimal code. HTML provides the structure and content, Tailwind CSS handles the styling and layout, and AlpineJS adds dynamic behavior and interactivity.
